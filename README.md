# FieldLineTracer
This function traces magnetic field lines to compute Poincar√© plots and connection length in tokamaks and stellarators given its 3-dimensional magnetic field components. 

# Definition of Field Line
A magnetic field line is a 3D curve for which the magnetic field is tangent at every point.
Define $\vec{\Gamma} \in \mathbf{R}^3$ as our 3D curve parametrized by $s \in \mathbf{R}$:
$$ \frac{\partial \vec{\Gamma}}{\partial s} = \vec{B}$$

For simplication, consider the different component of our cuve as follows: $ \Gamma_R = R $, $ \Gamma_{\phi} = \phi $ and $ \Gamma_Z = Z $.

To obtain the corresponding scalar components of the differential equation, the Jacobian needs to be taken into account.


## Cylindrical Coordinates
The differential equation in cylindrical coordinates $[R, \phi, Z]$ for the field lines being:
$$ \frac{\partial R}{\partial \phi} =  R \cdot \frac{B_R}{B_{\phi}}$$
$$ \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \phi} =  R \cdot \frac{B_Z}{B_{\phi}}$$

being the finite differences:
$$ R(k+1) = R(k) + \Delta \phi \cdot  R(k) \cdot \frac{B_R(k)}{B_{\phi}(k)}$$
$$ Z(k+1) = Z(k) + \Delta \phi \cdot  R(k) \cdot \frac{B_Z(k)}{B_{\phi}(k)}$$

## Toroidal Coordinates
The differential equation in toroidal coordinates [R, \phi, \theta] for the field lines being:
**Pending implementation**

# Limiter Geometry
If a limiter or divertor 3-dimensional geometry is available, an option can be selected to compute more realistic trajectories.

# 2D version
2D magnetic field and limiter can be easily replicated in the toroidal dimension to create a 3D version.



# Currently working version
At the moment, 'changes/Python' branch is the most updated. A pull request to 'main' branch of the *Python* version and completion of the *Fortran* version will be done soon.
